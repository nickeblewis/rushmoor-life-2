Step by Step are delighted that 2:09 Events Ltd have again chosen us to be their charity partner for the second Farnborough Winter Half Marathon and 5km Fun Run taking place on Sunday 21st January 2018.

A sell-out marathon in 2017, it promises to be a great event. The start and finish area will be under the famous Air Ship hangar in Farnborough Business Park. From the hangar the route takes you past the end of the runway and, with an improvement to the route in 2017, will continue adjacent to the runway emerging next to the Air Accident Investigation Centre. From here the route returns to the Business Park and passes the start at approx. 5 miles.

For those with families there is also a 5K Fun Run for children over the age of 8, and for 5 to 8 year olds an 800m Kiddies Run.
